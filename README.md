# Minecraft Minter

This is a project made to try out certain features of Web3. As a fun task I was trying to Mint minecraft skins and then render them on the FrontEnd. This was all done on the Ropsten network.

The main web3 libraries experimented on in this repo are:

- [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.2/)
- [@alch/alchemy-web3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alch/alchemy-web3)

## Other libraries used

- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - For UI
- [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) - For handling api calls
- [react-location](https://react-location.tanstack.com/) - For routing
- [react-skinview3d](https://github.com/Hacksore/react-skinview3d) - Rendering the Minecraft Skins
